Repository for my intelligent animation project. Uses computer vision techniques to extract the anatomical features of a monkey puppet from video and renders them with custom graphics and effects. Includes dynamic sound effects and collision detection.

To run:

open the .pde file with Processing and click 'Run'
(Note: requires image folders containing video frames and graphics used in the program.)

Premise:

One Punch Man punches a ton of smelly aliens

100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, and a 10km run EVERY SINGLE DAY
